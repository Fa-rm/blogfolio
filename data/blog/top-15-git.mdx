#15 Most Used Git Terminal Commands
If you're working with Git, you probably spend a lot of time in the terminal. Here are 15 Git commands that you'll likely use on a regular basis.

```git init```
The git init command initializes a new Git repository. It creates a new .git directory in the root of your project that will store all of the Git metadata for your project.

```git clone```
The git clone command creates a copy of an existing Git repository. It downloads the entire repository, including all of its files and commit history.

```git add .```
The git add command adds changes to the staging area. This prepares the changes to be committed to the repository.



```git status```
The git status command shows the status of your repository. It shows which files have been changed, which files are staged, and which files are not being tracked by Git.



```git commit```
The git commit command creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area. When you run this command, Git will prompt you to enter a commit message.

ruby

$ git commit -m "Add file.txt"
6. git push
