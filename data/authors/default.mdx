Hey, I'm Fred, a PM and indie-maker based in Oporto. I love to tinker with side projects and I'm passionate about self-teaching software development. In addition to my technical skills, I have a background in marketing and design, which allows me to approach projects with a well-rounded perspective. When I'm not coding, I enjoy writing essays on calm living, exploration, experiments, and making sense of the world. My DMs are always open, letÂ´s connect!
